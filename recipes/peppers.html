    <ul>
        <li>1/2 c. uncooked rice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (14.5-oz.) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 bell peppers, tops and cores removed</li>
        <li>1 c. shredded Monterey jack</li>
        <li>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°. In a small saucepan, prepare rice according to package instructions. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 6 minutes. Drain fat.</li>
        <li>Return beef mixture to skillet, then stir in cooked rice and diced tomatoes. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Let simmer until liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place peppers cut side-up in a 9"-x-13" baking dish and drizzle with oil. Spoon beef mixture into each pepper and top with Monterey jack, then cover baking dish with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake until peppers are tender, about 35 minutes. Uncover and bake until cheese is bubbly, 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
